In every generation kings come to power. Some gain their crowns through bloody conquest. Others the lucky sons of old rulers. Yet one thing is clear: All kings fall. Except for you of course! 

So how shall your enemies be destroyed? Shall it be by the poisoned cup or  the sword of your armies? Shall it be assassins in the night or disease in the streets? What devices will you employ to overthrow the kings and topple the tyrants who oppose you? Will you emerge victorious, or will you fall like all the others?
