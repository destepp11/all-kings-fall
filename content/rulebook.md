# Object of the Game

Kill the kings of other nations to win victory points. The nation with the most victory points at the end wins. We recommend playing to 10 victory points, but you can decide how many to play with.

# The Devices

There are four devices employed by kings. Each device is used to fight the device of the same name, with the exception of the cup.  
	
* **The Sword** - This device represents armies, the movement of troops, conquests and sieges as well as the defense against such things.
		
* **The Mask** - This device represents espionage and politics, as well as the efforts to uncover plots against you.  
		
* **The Rat** - This device represents food, plagues, and diseases, as well as the efforts to contain and cure them.* **The Rat** - This device represents plagues and diseases, as well as the efforts to contain and cure them.

* **The Cup** - This device represents those closest to you. Your family, your servants, and the very meals you eat. Poisoned or otherwise, every king drinks from his cup every night.

# How to Play
First, determine who should go first. This can be done any way you decide. Each player then adds to their hands two “Bolster” cards and one card representing every player in the game except themselves. The game then enters the following phases:
	
## **PLOTTING**

All players plot simultaneously. The decisions made in this phase are not permanent until all players agree to end the plotting phase. Each player selects two cards from their hand and places them face-down on one or more of their devices. Players can choose to bolster any of their four devices. Bolstering the cup counts as checking it. Lastly, they can choose to employ one or more of their devices against players, but cannot employ more than one of their devices against the same player in a single round. Once all players agree to continue, the game advances to the Reveal phase.
	
## **REVEAL**

All players turn face-up the cards they played in the plotting phase. Once all cards are face-up, the game advances to the Bolster phase.

## **BOLSTER**

Any device that was bolstered gains one token to its resource pool for each time it was bolstered this round. The cup does not have a resource pool and cannot accumulate tokens for being checked. Once all gains are tallied, the game advances to the Attack phase.

## **ATTACK**

Players who employed a device against another player do this now in the previously determined turn order. The attacker and defender each subtract one token of this device until one player has none. If the attacking player has any of this device remaining, they gain a victory point.

In the event that a player decides to attack two players with the same device, they choose how many of that device to send against each player.
	
The cup, however, is only stopped if the player it is employed against checked their cup this round. If the cup is checked, the attack fails. If the cup is not checked, the attacking player gains a victory point. 

Once all players have completed their attacks, and if no player has won the game, each player picks up the cards they played. This ends a round. The plotting phase begins again.

	
# Winning The Game

All players continue to play until a player reaches the target number of victory points. If two or more players reach the target number of points in the SAME ROUND, then the winner will be the first player to be ahead in points at the end of any subsequent rounds.
