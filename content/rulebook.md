# Object of the Game

Kill the kings of other nations to win victory points. The nation with the most victory points at the end wins. (Number of Victory Points needed is determined by players at the start of the game. More victory points means more forgiveness for failure, but makes game sessions take longer.)

# The Devices

There are four devices employed by kings. Each device is used to fight the device of the same name, with the exception of the cup. 
	
* The Sword - This device represents armies, the movement of troops, conquests and sieges as well as the defense against such things.
		
* The Mask - This device represents all assassination plots, sabotage, schemes and political manipulation, as well as the efforts to uncover them. 
		
* The Rat - This device represents plagues and diseases, as well as the efforts to contain and cure them.

* The Cup - The poisoned cup, the poisoned meal, and anything from old ladies selling fruit. The King fears most the deadly chalice whose stealthy poison may put a swift end to his reign. Each king drinks from their cup every turn.

# How to Play
First, determine who should go first. Turns take place clockwise from this person. The game then enters the following phases:
	
## **PLOTTING**

All players plot simultaneously. Each player selects two cards from their hand and places them face-down on one or more of their devices. The decisions made are not permanent until all players agree to end the plotting phase. Players can choose to bolster the sword, mask, or rat. They can also choose to check the cup. Lastly, they can choose to employ one or more of their devices against players, but cannot employ more than one of their devices against the same player in a single round. Once all players agree to continue, the game advances to the **Reveal** phase.
	
## **REVEAL**

All players turn face-up the cards they played in the plotting phase. Once all cards are face-up, the game advances to the **Bolster** phase.

## **BOLSTER**

Any device that was bolstered gains one token to its resource pool for each time it was bolstered this round. Once all gains are tallied, the game advances to the **Attack** phase.

## **ATTACK**

Players who employed a device against another player do this now, in the previously determined turn order. The attacker and defender each subtract one token of this device until one player has none. If the attacking player has any of this device remaining, they gain a victory point.

In the event that a player decides to attack two players with the same device, they choose how many of that device to send against each player.
	
The cup, however, is only challenged by the target player checking the cup. If the cup is checked, the attack fails. If the cup is not checked, the attacking player gains a victory point. 

Once all players have completed their attacks, and if no player has won the game, each player picks up the cards they played. This ends a round. The **plotting** phase begins again.
	
# Winning The Game
All players continue to play until a player reaches the target number of victory points. If two or more players reach the target number of points in the SAME ROUND, Then the winner will be the first player to be ahead in points at the end of any subsequent rounds.
